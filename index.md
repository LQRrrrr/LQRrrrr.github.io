  Welcome! Here is Qiuran's personal website. My name is Qiuran Lyu (吕秋燃 in Chinese). I was born in Chengdu, Sichuan, P. R. China on November 1st, 2001. From Sep 2016 to July 2019, I studied at<a href="http://www.cdqz.net"> No.7 high school</a>. I entered to <a href="https://www.ruc.edu.cn"> Renmin University of China(RUC) </a> in 2019, majoring in <a href="http://stat.ruc.edu.cn">Statistics</a> (RUC ranks top3 in this subject among all universities in China).  I am expected to graduate on July 2023 and lucky to get National Scholarship twice (2021,2022 the highest honor for college students in China). Now I am applying for Statistics/Biostatistics Ph.D. programs in the United States.

  My research interests lie in statistical genetics, causal inference, and mediation analysis. I decided to apply to Ph.D. programs last year when I visited <a href="https://www.hku.hk/l">the univerisity of Hong Kong</a> and I am extremely fortunate to be guided by <a href="https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/jingshenwang/"> Prof.Jingshen Wang</a> at UC Berkeley from Feb 2022 and did my summer research in <a href="http://jsb.ucla.edu/people/jingyi-jessica-li">JSB group</a> at UC Los Angeles mentored by postdoc Dr.Xinzhou Ge and Prof.Jingyi Jessica Li. I am also very lucky to be offered the chance to study at <a href="https://sites.harvard.edu/junliu/">Prof.Jun S Liu's</a> lab at Harvard. See work for what I have done in 2022.

  Due to some personal experiences, I want to make contributions in public health field regarding to various diseases.
