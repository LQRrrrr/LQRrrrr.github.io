<p>
My name is Qiuran (Rita) Lyu. I am a second-year student in the UC Berkeley Biostatistics Division MA/PhD track. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by **[Dr. Jingshen Wang](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/jingshenwang/)**. Before coming to Berkeley, I completed my undergraduate major in Statistics and minor in Fintech from Renmin University of China Statistics department and Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence. In 2022, I was fortunate to be a visiting student at **[JSB lab](http://jsb.ucla.edu)** in UCLA and advised by **[Dr. Jingyi Jessica Li](http://jsb.ucla.edu/about-jingyi-jessica-li)** and **[Dr. Xinzou Ge](https://stat.oregonstate.edu/directory/xinzhou-shawn-ge)** and a visiting student at **[Dr. Jun S. Liu](https://sites.harvard.edu/junliu/)**'s lab in Harvard University. From then on, I developed great interest in the junction of Statistics and Artificial Intelligence for Biology & Healthcare tasks.
</p>
<p>
My research interests lie in Causal Inference, Health equity, LLM inference, Computational Biology,and AI for Science & Healthcare. I am currently working on the topic "How to develop robust metric to have better statistical inference in finetuned (multimodal) LLM".
