  Welcome! Here is Qiuran's personal website. My name is Qiuran Lyu (吕秋燃 in Chinese). I was born in Chengdu, Sichuan, P. R. China on November 1st, 2001. From Sep 2016 to July 2019, I studied at<a href="http://www.cdqz.net"> No.7 high school </a> . I entered to <a href="https://www.ruc.edu.cn"> Renmin University of China(RUC) </a> in 2019, majoring in <a href="http://stat.ruc.edu.cn"> Statistics </a> (RUC ranks top3 in this subject among all universities in China).  I am expected to graduate on July 2023 and lucky to get National Scholarship twice (2021, 2022 the highest honor for college students in China). I am an incoming 2023 fall student for Biostatistics MA/PHD program at UC Berkeley.

  My research interests lie in statistical genomics, causal inference, mediation analysis, and computational biology. See work for what I have done in 2022. I am also interested in applying machine learning to financial data.
