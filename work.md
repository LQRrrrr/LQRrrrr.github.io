    description: We used structural equation to construct the relationship between mediator, exposure, and outcome effect based on the causal diagram. A three-step procedure is designed for conducting mediation analysis with integrated multiple GWAS using joint rerandomization and rao-blackwellization to eliminate the winner’s curse.
  - title: Mendelian Randomization with Summary Data

    description: We empirically demonstrated the winner’s curse for MR estimators caused by LD clumping. We also empirically demonstrated rerandomization and rao-blackwellization can reduce bias for thirteen popular Mendelian Randomization estimators.
  - title: Benchmark of different isoform quantification methods

    description: Performance of rsem, kallisto, cufflinks, salmon on simulated dataset were compared and we empirically demonstrated rsem has the worst performance in terms of power and false discovery rate.
  - title: GMS training framework and WMMLP

      alt: sand
    description: We constructed the weighted multiplicative MLP (WMMLP) in PyTorch based on taylor expansion of M estimators and used neural networks to solve M-estimation problem under the bootstrap and cross validation context.
