      alt: water
    description: We used structural equation to construct the relationship between mediator, exposure, and outcome effect based on the causal diagram. A three-step procedure was designed for conducting mediation analysis with integrated multiple GWAS using joint rerandomization and rao-blackwellization to eliminate the winner’s curse. (working on)

    description: We empirically demonstrated the winner’s curse caused by LD clumping. We also empirically demonstrated rerandomization and rao-blackwellization can reduce bias for thirteen popular Mendelian Randomization estimators. (preparing manuscript)
  - title: Benchmark of different isoform quantification methods + FastQTL

    description: We compared performance of rsem, kallisto, cufflinks, salmon + FastQTL on simulated dataset and we empirically demonstrated rsem has the worst performance in terms of power and false discovery rate.

    description: We constructed the weighted multiplicative MLP (WMMLP) in PyTorch based on Taylor expansion of M estimators and used neural networks to solve M-estimation problem under the bootstrap and cross validation context.
